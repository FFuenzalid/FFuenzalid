- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FFuenzalid, a self taught software developer with a strong background in `Python` programming. 
      In addition to Python, I have also worked with technologies such as `HTML`, `JavaScript`, `C++`, `Docker`, and `Linux`. 
      This allows me to approach projects with a diverse set of skills and the ability to choose the best tools for the job.
      at this time (2022) i have experiencie in a lot of fields in the area. I've develop a lot of solutions from small to industrial sized ones
      with technologies that varies from IOT with esp8266 microcrontroler to GPC with data workflows for industrial data management.
      
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in STEM overall. I really got into programing in 2016 when i just get this idea that all of the universe is just mere information, 
      and somehow this connect the world of physics with the world of information, thus translating the equations into terms of philosophy and math (Logic and Statements),
      and maybe and just maybe there is a link between the universe and the nature of our reallity. So here i am trying to understand the world by this approach.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Docker, Networking and Software Design in order to develop more complex solutions. 
      in the near future i hope to start developing aplications that can help people in general to reach the gifts of technology.
